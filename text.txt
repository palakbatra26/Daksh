implement the ai content detection feature on our app 

i want to use edinAi api for this:

const axios = require("axios");

const options = {
  method: "POST",
  url: "https://api.edenai.run/v2/text/ai_detection",
  headers: {
    authorization: "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiOGYwNmQ2Y2QtMjI5Yi00YTBjLWI0ZGMtMTBjNDBmZjkyMDJmIiwidHlwZSI6ImFwaV90b2tlbiJ9._f8eNDku7jZr9bxz9Kfo3SaOUaJ3qORfromZ_0v99yg",
  },
  data: {
    providers: "winstonai",
    text: "Your text goes here", // Change this to the text you want to analyze
  },
};

axios
  .request(options)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error.response) {
      console.error("Error response:", error.response.data);
    } else {
      console.error("Error:", error.message);
    }
  });


the above given is the code snippet to use the api.

the below given is the response format of the api :

{
  "sapling": {
    "ai_score": 0.970070276931997,
    "items": [
      {
        "text": "The panther, also known as the black panther, is a magnificent and enigmatic creature that captivates the imagination of many.",
        "prediction": "ai-generated",
        "ai_score": 0.9990817176020741,
        "ai_score_detail": 0.9990817176020741
      },
       
      {
        "text": "Habitat loss, poaching, and illegal wildlife trade pose significant threats to their existence. Various organizations and governments are working tirelessly to protect these magnificent creatures through initiatives such as establishing protected areas, promoting sustainable land use practices, and raising awareness about their importance in the natural world.",
        "prediction": "ai-generated",
        "ai_score": 0.9999,
        "ai_score_detail": 0.9999
      }
    ],
    "cost": 0
  }
}

create a new page at /ai-detection and implement the same

  .request(options)
  .then((response) => {

example:


Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]
